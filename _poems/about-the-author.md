## Part 1

The ad on Instagram says:   
*"85% of people worldwide,   
both adolescents and adults,   
are affected by low self esteem."*   

I find it complicated to introduce myself. Strangers assume I'm humble and meek,   
but I have always been burdened with self-confidence issues.   
If you asked me to name one thing I'm proud about:   
I would collapse into powdered soot trying to pronounce my name.  

Hi. My name is Mark Henison Madelo Madelo.   
I prefer to go by Marcus.   
My birthday is the 30th of September.   
(In astrology terms, I am a "Libra"   
and I cannot decide if that's a good thing or not.)  

I like commuting on the crusty c-trains   
and grubby beer-stenched buses of Calgary transit.   
I like abandoning myself in random neighborhoods,   
chasing curbsides on scuffed skateboard decks,   
binge listening to music albums back to back.   
(My favourite music artists are: A Tribe Called Quest,   
J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Digable Planets,   
Baby Keem, De La Soul and BROCKHAMPTON.)   

I like getting lost in places I know well   
just to memorize each detail buried   
in the basement of each building.   
I like curating playlists that captivate   
certain ambiences and Bohemian vibes.   
I like the smell of coffee when it's been sitting out,   
soaking up sundry rays of sunlight without being sipped once.   
I like wearing hoodies that swallow my body whole.   
I like flicking my fingers against the fluttering staccato   
of my four string bass guitar I named "Felix".   
I love reading poems and watching them be performed.   
I love Spoken Word and that's how I started as a writer.   

## Part 2

When I compose a poem,   
I embed a repeated structure in each sentence.   

When I compose a poem,   
I type assortments of alliterations,   
where they intoxicate the reader's tongue   
and taze their tonsils limp and numb.   

When I compose a poem,   
I make my fingers finesse a keyboard   
and convince it that I'm a chiropractor   
for the problems it never it never knew it carried.   

When I perform a poem,  
I see the stanzas I've scribbled in certain colours.   
I search for shades and hues in the shadows cast from spotlights.   
I squint when I scout those pigments and tints hiding softly within silence.   

When I perform a poem,   
my mouth moves with momentum,  
my lips speak nonstop until they are cracked and chapped   
and my asthma lunges out and assaults my lungs.  

## Part 3

Sometimes it takes a prayer, a deep breath   
and a tug of war with myself to get out of bed.   
I've chosen my bedsheets so the first thing   
that comes to mind when I go to sleep is that I'm cozy,   
rather than remind myself of my roommate named Depression.   

Rudy Francisco defines his depression as   
"an angry deity, a jealous god, a thirsty shadow   
that wrings [his] joy like a dishrag   
and makes juice out of [his] smile."   

But my Depression is the neighbor   
I choose to have conversations with on certain days.   
My Depression is the white noise cluttering   
the soundtrack I compiled the night before.   

But today I survived; that is my accomplishment for today.   
I don't show off that medal beside my own name tag.   
Instead, I leave it pinned up on the creased collar   
on the left side of my shirt,   
above this purple heart I bear   
from all the times I have been too hard on myself.
