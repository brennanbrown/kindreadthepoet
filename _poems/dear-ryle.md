excerpt: I, who was socialized into a 'man', do not allow my anger to be unleashed...
---
I, who was socialized into a "man",\
do not allow my anger to be unleashed out my fists. 

I simply cope by straining my wrists & flexing my fingertips\
into Corinthian arches. My forearms brace themselves\
into Tuscan columns and I scratch & chafe & etch mazes 

against the circumference of my epidermis.   

I have seen, in numerous films & mainstream media,\
my forefathers turn strangers noses into rufous fountains,\
crimson cascades in a sudden-flash.   

I have seen the way shame shakes my shoulders\
& makes me shiver, the way it makes me stutter my words\
& shutter into my chalice shell.   

I have seen the way my guilt makes my ego\
guard my heart from getting held accountable.\
I have seen how my insecurity cause me to second guess myself\
& back down from being seen.   

My childhood trauma consists of\
seeing teeth transformed into theatre seats\
for treading tears & silent sobs;\
I have seen jawlines\
sharpen through jagged grinding of incisors,\
in certain instances I catch my tongue wanting to tease out\
these cracked lips, and shatter its rattle.   

Last night I repeated the same mantra\
in my mental space, asking the lord or any other filipino deity\
to help me comprehend or properly pronounce my suppressed emotions\
in steady and concise paragraphs, instead of a gaping roar.\
instead of pocketing myself in the shell of my painted husk\
instead of allowing Depression to pickpocket my happiness\
and install a jailbreak version of someone else's smile\
stitched into my weary cheeks.   

Recently I checked how much patience\
I have preserved and my savings continue to produce ten folds.\
I look onto the "role model men" who mold my world\
around their own incentives and materialistic hoarding\
by spending the worker classes' millions of dollars\
on fire-arms and underground military bases.  

My tax dollars probably pay for war crimes in Third World countries,\
so I have decided to invest it all into a panopticon for my passions,\
and a federal prison where these haunting demons have been placed;\
to free roam and sleep on wooden ramps\
while the blind crows and toothless alligator exchange\
a laughing moment within I, the kaiju's, stomach.
