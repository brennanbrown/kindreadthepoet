excerpt: "I, who was socialized into a 'man', do not allow my anger to be unleashed..."
---

I, who was socialized into a "man",   
do not allow my anger to be unleashed   
out my fists. I simply cope by flexing my fingertips   
into corinthian arches, my forearms brace themselves   
into Tuscan columns and making them scratch   
and chafe against the circumference of my epidermis.   

I have seen, in numerous films and mainstream media,   
my forefathers turn strangers noses into rufous fountains,   
crimson cascades in a sudden-flash.   

I have seen the way shame shakes my shoulders  
& makes me shiver, the way it makes me stutter my words  
& shutter into my chalice shell.   

I have seen the way my guilt makes my ego   
guard my heart from getting held accountable.   
I have seen my insecurity cause me to second guess myself  
and back down from being seen.   

My childhood trauma consists of   
seeing teeth transformed into theatre seats   
for treading tears and silent sobs;  
I have seen jawlines   
sharpen through jagged grinding of incisors,   
in certain instances I catch my tongue wanting to tease out   
these cracked lips, and shatter its rattle.   

Last night I repeated the same mantra   
in my mental space, asking the lord or any other filipino deity   
to help me comprehend or properly pronounce my suppressed emotions   
in steady and concise paragraphs, instead of a gaping roar.  
instead of pocketting myself in the shell of my painted husk   
instead of allowing Depression to pickpocket my happiness   
and install a jailbreak version of someone else's smile   
stitched into my weary cheeks.   

Recently I checked how much patiences   
I have preserved and my savings continue to produce ten folds.   
I look onto the "role model men" who mold my world   
around their own incentives and materialistic hoarding   
by spending the worker classes' millions of dollars   
on fire-arms and underground military bases.  

My tax dollars probably pay for war crimes in Third World countries,   
so I have decided to invest it all into a panopticon for my passions,   
and a federal prison where these haunting demons have been placed;  
to free roam and sleep on wooden ramps   
while the blind crows and toothless alligator exchange   
a laughing moment within I, the kaijus, stomach.
