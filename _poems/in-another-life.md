## Part 1  

Her and I  
were once a pair of fingers  
that spent months musing over the fretboard  
of a freshly thrifted bass guitar.  

We spent handfuls of hours   
whistling white noise.  
We bounced back and forth between barren parking lots,   
buried in between each steel inlay,   
slashing away at aisles of rose bushes  
while our blood splattered Renaissance murals   
on top of newly emptied-out pavement.   

We spent semesters sprinting across sidewalk paths,  
seeping our bare heels into the sheer cold   
of vacant chorus-composing concrete,   
with rhapsody speed bumps embedded into the seamlines.  

We spent seconds salvaging patches   
of our skin that shedded and blistered  
while we   
were feeling   
the stammering  
and seething stings  
radiating off the four steel strings.  

We never knew what song we were going to play,  
nor which verse we started on,   
nor how long the interlude would linger  
nor how we got here in the first place.  

All we knew was that when a pattern was made:  
our laughs choreographed themselves into a catchy chorus,  
and our kindred souls captured that,   
manifesting it into our matching heartbeat  
for this very moment.   

## Part 2  

I was once blue splattered first onto the palette  
while you were red laid to rest beside me.   
God was the paintbrush.  

His bristles made us dance together in circles,   
where I twirled you in waves   
while sunsets shattered,  
and eventually   
we gave birth to a purple pastel.  

With every stroke that was smeared onto the sanguine surface,   
she filled up the canvas   
with her obnoxious smile  
that had segments of us   
scattered thoroughly   
within the still life sketch   
of the sunrise.   

## Part 3  

Her and I   
were once two sides of the same electrical cord,   
often tangled between each other,  
building knots and kneading bundles of bridges  
on top cedar, oak and birch floorboards.   

One evening I broke my back  
bracing myself into high beams  
to build us a humble home,  
with sky-high ceilings,   
auxiliary offices on every sixth floor  
and underground parking lots  
for our hordes of indoor slippers   
and outdoor shoes.   

I remembered how my arms  
baled around her body in the bed,   
how her beige eyes blinked mindlessly,   
gazing endlessly up and into my angles.  

I remembered her swaying softly   
while I held my breath   
to change into a hammock,  
holding onto the thought that she   
could never despise this haven I assembled.   

But I shrugged it off,   
convincing myself those clusters of sparks   
slugging off her skull were signs she loved me back,  
but really they were just empty shells of a shotgun.  

I passed out,   
waking up to the fumbling dance   
of a fire no longer flickering   
but instead loitering leisurely  
on top where scars foamed up on our flesh   
and flakes of skin were filtered   
across fissuring gaps  
upon the charred up floorboards.   

I blamed myself,   
battering the bullet point  
straight into the streetlines of my brain  
that I was a buffoon for not hearing her beg for mercy.   

I wonder often if she tried slithering out to escape.   
Or what would've happened if she slipped a sliver   
of a whisper into my ear to tell me:  
"Please stop suffocating me in my sleep."  

Or what would've happened if she slamped her shoulder   
into my stomach and seethed her teeth  
into my skin while she screamed:  
"Let me out!"  

Or what would've happened if she slit my eyelids   
away from sitting shut to let me see the signs   
that I was doing too much in such a short amount of time.   

Or what would've happened if I stopped thinking   
and actually tried to save her,   
instead of reminiscing these tragedies   
and turning them into scattered tattoos  
to commemorate for the next lifetime.   

I  
am  
sorry.
