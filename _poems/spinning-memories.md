excerpt: "You are another memory that needs to go. An assembly of laughs and smiles..."
---

You are another memory that needs to go.   
An assembly of laughs and smiles   
I auction off to the silence   
who craves a goodnight story.   
I tell them that your voice was the sound of a doorbell,   
reminding me of home.   

Your photos always piled up on my phone,   
like a Pinterest mood board describing my day.   
If I could, I'd exchange my eyes for cameras   
and take snapshots of everything   
you told me was precious.   
I'd frame the portraits and landscapes,   
hanging them in the horizon   
so they can sit beside these clouds.   
I'd call that claustrophobic canvas:   
a gallery of my own thoughts   
just trying to find where they belong.   
I'd tell you the name of each piece   
and turn your sentences of wonder   
into the lines that transformed them into constellations.   
That became my definition of "love".  

Some days I traded my ears for headphones   
and they played the things you always said to me on loop   
just so I could do my best to stay optimistic for the day.   
Sometimes I asked the silence on the bus to mimic your laugh   
to not feel so lonely and in some ways   
I looked for carnations wherever I went   
just so I could imagine you being beside me again one more time.   
Now I remember your laugh,   
then compare it to the sound of rubber burning into concrete.   
I'll crease and fold your freckles into a key   
that opens a flashback of horrors.   
I'll make these lips think about kissing you   
synonymously as smoking.   
I'll turn your photos into water   
and remind myself of the feeling of drowning   
and then eventually I'll learn how to start swimming   
instead of endlessly floating . . .  

The hardest part is handling the truth   
that I don't have the ability to pull out   
the same smile I reserved for you when we were together.   
I don't have the same laugh   
that you recorded on your phone   
and used as an alarm clock the very next day.   
I don't have the same sense of confidence   
to wake up in the morning,   
so I let my blankets bury me 'til midnight.   
I've convinced myself that my own arms   
are the only sweater this body deserves to be wrapped in.   
I tell the piercing stillness of the night   
the moments we shared and hope it turns into a prayer   
to be embedded within the ocean,   
to stay uncovered and untouched   
and to never be bothered.  

But to be honest,   
It's been hard to move on   
when these memories I try to spin   
decide to gamble the same game with me.   
They push me into different directions   
I never knew existed until now.   
I tried using a GPS to get to my destination,   
but to be honest half the time   
I didn't know where I'm going,   
so I got lost.   

I carried my corpse through countless paths   
that were just cul-de-sacs and detours.   
I left my limbs on layover flights   
trying to follow my own footsteps.   
I hung my head over the highway   
hoping to hear the howls of my house.   
I finally found my way home,   
rang the doorbell and wondered   
why it didn't sound so familiar   
and now I remember how this all started because of how:  
I miss you.
